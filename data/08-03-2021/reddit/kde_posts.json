Theoretically should work for all, but theoretically. Always you can report bug is something doesn't work.\n\nBTW. Is it possible also to reformat whole project. To do this you need to click in root dire in Project view you will see option \"Reformat files...\". Notice that also is available setting of format style by project. If you will click into root dir your project and click into option \"Open Configuration\" you will find \"Source Formater\".",
