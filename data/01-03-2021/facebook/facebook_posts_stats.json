		"message": "Letters from Kate:\n\nDear Internet,\n\n2021 has just started, but it has already been a great month for me! I have so many things to tell you about.\n\nTake my Quick Open dialog, for example: it not only got a nice facelift, but also a new fuzzy matching algorithm.\n\nAnother thing I got is a fancy head-up display that lets you easily find menu items. If it exists, I'll find it!\n\nCombine that with my new search-and-replace text feature and semantic highlighting and your productivity will shoot through the roof.\n\nI could go on all evening, but they say that the good, when brief, is twice as good.\n\nStay safe!\n\nXOXO\n\nKate\n\nhttps://kate-editor.org/post/2021/2021-01-24-kate-january-2021/",
