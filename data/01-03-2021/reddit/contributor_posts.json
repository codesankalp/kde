The virtual keyboard does not work on my Surface Pro 4 or on my ASUS laptop. The indicator says it's enabled, but it won't come up when I select a text box in any application, to include KDE Plasma applications.\n\nThis is freaking frustrating! This issue was reported back with the release of 5.20, when the virtual keyboard on the desktop was \"broken\" in favor of fixing an issue with Plasma Mobile (???). I thought 5.21 was supposed to finally fix it, yet it still doesn't work. Despite all of the improvements to Wayland, without a keyboard, the session is useless to me!",
